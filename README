Sortable Coding Challenge

My entry for the Sortable coding challenge at http://sortable.com/blog/coding-challenge/.


USAGE

Run challeng.cpp in a CPP editor to create result.txt file as per the required format.

INPUT: products.txt and listings.txt should be present in the same directory as the cpp code.

OUTPUT: Generate result.txt file the same directory.

TEMPORARY FILES: mfc_lst.txt, mdl_lst.txt and mdl_chk.txt are generated using function called mfcmdl_x() to create
mentioned text file but can be bypassed by using comments(//mfcmdl_x()) if no new products are added to products.txt
after the first run.
**However, the three mentioned files are required to successfully generate the result.txt file.**
